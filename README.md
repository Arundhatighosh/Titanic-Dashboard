# Titanic-Dashboard
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset involved a preliminary examination of key variables. We explored passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors influencing survival. Initial findings revealed a higher survival rate among females, children, and first-class passengers. We also examined missing data and outliers, leading to data preprocessing steps. Visualizations, such as treemaps, column charts and key influencers aided in understanding data distributions and relationships. We also explored the impact of gender and embarked location on survival. Missing data and outliers were addressed, and correlation analysis showed relationships between variables. EDA thus helped identify potential predictors for further analysis, providing valuable insights into the Titanic dataset's characteristics and informing subsequent modeling efforts for predicting passenger survival.
